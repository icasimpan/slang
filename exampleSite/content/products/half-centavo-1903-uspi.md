The Philippine half-centavo coin (½¢), a denomination of Philippine currency, was issued when the Philippines was under US administration. It bears the names of both countries: Filipinas (the Spanish name of the Philippines) and the United States of America.

Filipino sculptor Melecio Figueroa was hired to design the coin. It features a man with a hammer and anvil, seating in front of Mayon Volcano.

In 1903 and 1904, the US mint at Philadelphia struck bronze-minted half-centavo coins for circulation.[3] Eventually, the coin was withdrawn from circulation because it was rejected by Filipinos for its low value. After 1908, all remaining half centavos were melted.
